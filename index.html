                            <h2>​​The Benefits of Working with a Luxury Presence Agent</h2>
                            <p>One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to market
                                your
                                property
                                to the right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be
                                able to
                                identify who will be interested in your property and implement effective strategies to
                                reach
                                them
                                via their website, paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work with
                                an agent
                                who
                                has partnered with Luxury Presence, you benefit from the many different types of
                                marketing
                                capabilities the company offers.</p>

                            <h2>Paid Advertising on All Channels</h2>
                            <p>To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they spend their
                                time
                                online,
                                and how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing
                                services
                                are
                                able to identify your niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram,

                                YouTube
                                that reach those interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly
                                customized and
                                targeted, ensuring you are not spending money marketing to those who are not in the

                                property such as yours.</p>

                            <h2>Expert Content Production</h2>
                            <p>Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your
                                property.
                                Being
                                able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool
                                that
                                elevates
                                the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors.
                                According to a
                                recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses
                                video—and
                                for
                                good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a
                                deeper level
                                and
                                build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing
                                viewers
                                what
                                it would really be like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much
                                more
                                difficult
                                to do with a written description.
                                However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to
                                be
                                described
                                in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is
                                created to
                                sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real
                                estate
                                copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your

                            <p>Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they purchased on the
                                internet. Many
                                of
                                them simply googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their
                                search
                                that
                                way. For your home to show up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs
                                to use
                                the
                                right terms in your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as

                                engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using the right
                                terms is a
                                bit
                                of a science—one that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential
                                buyer
                                searches terms that match your home, your property will show up in the results and
                                provide
                                opportunities for the buyer to learn more.</p>

                            <p>If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to
                                thousands of
                                niche buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either
                                needs to
                                dedicate a large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury
